\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}{../png/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Kanban}
\subsection{Origins}
Kanban, as a method for managing and transmiting knowledge, was invented in 1953
by Taiichi Ohno as part of the Toyota Production System (TPS), which later was
adopted by other companies and is regarded as one of the most influential systems,
if not the most, behind the Lean Manufacturing philosofy. As a methodology
developed for a company - Toyota Motors - operating in the war-devastated Japan
and competing against well estabilished US companies, TPS focused on reducing
overburden, inconsistencies and waste. In order to achieve those goals, a set of
guiding principles, which became known as \textit{The Toyota Way}. Some of those
principles are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface
  \item Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous
  improvement and employee empowerment.
  \item Use visual control so no problems are hidden.
  \item Use pull systems to avoid overproduction.
  \item Level out the workload (work like the tortoise, not the hare).
\end{itemize}

While the first two are clearly lean principles, the other three will be revisited
later in this section, as they are essential for understanding the current Kanban.
Central to this notion of eliminating waste is Toyota's
Just in Time (JIT), where a component is only produced when it is needed by
a station further beyond in the production pipeline. So Kanban was invented so that
there was an easy way to spot innefiencies in the material flow of an assembly
line, such as bottlenecks and waste (in this case, that would be having unused
materials, or inventory).

\subsection{What is it}
\label{whatis}

Kanban is japanese for signboard (\textit{kan} means card and \textit{ban} means signal), and in
the TPS it's just that: a physical board that workers write on and move around
which they use to communicate material requirements. When a station needs a certain
material, they fill a Kanban and deliver it in the station that produces it.

However, Kanban has evolved to be more than that, and is currently not restricted to visualization,
but is regarded as a lightweight framework for project management. The way it works is the
following: you have a board with several columns, each representing a stage of the process.
Then, you add to the first column the tasks you are starting, and move them to the next
column as soon as they enter that stage of the process.
In figure \ref{kanban_dev}, one of example of this mechanic would be: task J is under
development, and as soon as it is considered \textit{Done} it can be moved to testing.
 It may seem too simplistic, but we have to keep in mind Toyota's Way \textit{Use visual control so no problems are
hidden}. There is more than meets the eye though, because as we already stated before,
Kanban is more than visualization. Below we outline Kanban's core principles.
We will elaborate on how to use a Kanban effectively throughout this section.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{kanban-board}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex,
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
\caption{Example Kanban for software development.}
\label{kanban_dev}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Flow instead of batch}
Unlike time-boxed methods like Scrum, where the whole planning orbitates around
a sprint, in Kanban there is the notion of continuous flow: tasks keep comming
in and being delivered, teams don't have to wait until the end of the sprint
to deploy the changes. This idea is highly compatible with lean principles and
continuous integration practices.

\subsubsection{Definition of done}
As in other agile methodologies, such as Scrum, it is pivotal to have a clear
and strict definition of done, since tasks can only move from one column to the
next when those conditions are met. This definition is stage-specific, meaning
that in our example there must be a definition for Development, Testing, Deployment, etc.
Example definitions for our Kanban in figure \ref{kanban_dev} could be, respectively: \textit{"Satisfies user story or fixes bug"},
\textit{"Passes all tests, including regression ones, and has at least 60\% converage"}
and \textit{"Is deployed in our production servers and users have access to it"}.
The absence of such definitions decrease a team's velocity, since its members would
have to stop being productive to wonder, or discuss, if a certain task should be
moved to the next stage. When a task is considered Done in a certain stage, it is
passed into that stage's sub-column, ready to be pulled (we will explain what
this means in the following paragraph).

\subsubsection{Pull instead of push}
Tasks are not assigned to a person, but instead each person will grab a task for
a number of different ones available, as long as they're in the first column, or in a done state. It's like going
to the supermarket: the products are there for you to chose from.
Even if Toyota's \textit{Use pull systems to avoid overproduction.} may not seem
to apply to software development, it is still used in Kanban. The rationale behind
it is that it gives people autonomy, thus increases velocity as well as satisfaction.
It's a reflex of Toyota's \textit{Respect for people}.
In software development, this practice can manifest itself in several ways.
For instances, developments teams do not hand out their code for QA, instead QA teams
will pick \textit{Done} features and start working on them.
It can also impact DevOps/Release teams, where the teams which handle deployment aren't waiting
for development to hand them the production-ready code, what they do is create
the necessary infrastructure for any developer to be able to put their code into
production without much trouble. This is how engineering teams work at Spotify.
Again, notice how lean and close to continuous integrations this practice is.

\subsubsection{Work in progress}
If tasks are picked and not assigned, there is the risk of stalling the system,
having many tasks in the pipeline, but few in the final stage. It can also happen
that team members decide to pull too many tasks for themselves, losing productivity
to multi-tasking and context-switching.
To avoid this kind of problem, as well as maintain an healthy flow in the system,
Kanban uses limit the Work in progress (WIP). WIP means that there is a certain
capacity associated to each column (besides the first and the last ones) and that
you can't pull more tasks in a column that is already full. Both ongoing and
done tasks contribute to reaching the WIP's capacity. In figure \ref{kanban_dev} you can see WIP red numbers.
Each team must find the balance between having a low WIP, so they avoid the problems
outlined ealier, but not so low that it starts getting in the way of productivity.
Finding the right WIP is highly specific to each team and stage. For instances,
it may make sense for a team of 5 developers to have a WIP of 10 in the development
stage, but it would be unproductive for the same team, if they have a single tester,
to have the same WIP in the test phase.

\subsubsection{Estimation, prioritization and delivery times}
A criticism made to Kanban, mainly for people with Waterfall or Scrum backgrounds,
is that predictability is low. Since the methodology does not enforce estimation,
there is no way to track velocity or to predict delivery timings.
There are two answers for this: the first is that you can actually have a reasonable
way to track velocity, if that's what you really want, and the second is that
you don't need to track it.
For the first case, if you measure how many tasks you complete for a given time window,
you can have an estimate of your team's velocity. Even if each task may have different
weights, in the long term you can get a rough estimate.
The reason why it is not important for Kanban to measure velocity, is that it focus
on the long term: remember Toyota's \textit{work like the tortoise, not the hare}.
By having a continuous flow of work while giving ownership and autonomy to your team
members, you are assuring maximum productivity for each task. So the estimated
completion time for a task would be as soon as possible. There is, however, space
for prioritization: you can say that bugs get an higher priority
than features, so that bug-related tasks move faster across the pipeline and are
completed and deployed sooner.
Have in mind that, by being a lightweight framework rather than enforcing a
set of strict rules, like for instances Extreme Programming does, there is
space to modify Kanban for your own context. You can for instances use Kanban
in conjunction with Scrum, and model a sprint in terms of a Kanban board.
More on this in the next section.

\subsection{Relating to other methodologies}
\subsubsection{Open Allocation}
Some highly sucessful tech companies, like Github and Valve, have been using
this project scheduling methodology. Open allocation means can transfer between
projects regardless of headcount allowances, performance reviews, or tenure at
the company, as long as they are providing value to projects that are useful to
the business goals of the company. Its a way of self-organization, and very
similar to the principles of \textit{Respect for people} (by entrusting them
with responsability) and \textit{Use pull systems}, as we have seen earlier.
\subsubsection{Kanban and other methodologies}
We could easily match Scrum and Kanban together, having the sprint phases modeled
as columns, so we would end up with columns named sprint backlog, task breakdown,
development, etc. The Scrum roles and rituals are also compatible with Kanban,
there is nothing stopping a team from having a Product Owner and Scrum Master,
or doing daily standups while doing Kanban.
The same applies to any other software development workflows, such
as XP or Waterfall.

\subsection{Testing}
As we have discussed before, Kanban is compatible with testing, since it is able to
accomodate it in any phase of the process, as there are no guidelines regarding how it should, or should not, be done.
You can include every level of testing, or specification of testing, in your Kanban
workflow.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The Kanban board will act as a single point of communication for the
team, so everyone is synchronized and aware of the state of the work being done.
\textit{Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface}.
Its job is to make bottlenecks clear and as soon as possible. \textit{Use visual control so no problems are hidden}.
The philosophy also recommends a set of principles to achieve maximum flow in the
pipeline while maintaining quality (assured by addind QA stages/columns into your process).

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure

% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure

% e.g., \subfloat[].

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
